calibre is an e-book manager. It can view, convert, edit and catalog e-books 
in all of the major e-book formats. It can also talk to e-book reader 
devices. It can go out to the internet and fetch metadata for your books. 
It can download newspapers and convert them into e-books for convenient 
reading. It is cross platform, running on Linux, Windows and macOS.

https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/develop.html#debugging-tips

This is Kovidâ€™s favorite way to debug. Simply insert print statements at points of interest and run your program in the terminal. For example, you can start the GUI from the terminal as:

calibre-debug -g
Similarly, you can start the E-book viewer as:

calibre-debug -w /path/to/file/to/be/viewed
The e-book-editor can be started as:

calibre-debug -t /path/to/be/edited

You cant really use calibre code in external python interpreters, except on linux, if you install calibre system-wide. On windows, if you want to use calibre use calibre-debug as the python interpreter.
